Steps to bootstrap an AMQP server into your Nimbul Architecture:

  A. Security Groups
    1. Create a Security Group called AMQP
    2. Create a series of firewall rules, one for each amazon account you have, like so:
       Name: Allow ALL From flock-managed To AMQP
       EC2 User Id: <amazon account id>
       Group Name: flock-managed
    3. NOTE: this assumes that you use 'flock-managed' as your Default Security group for nimbul
       as defined on the Provider Account "Security" tab. If that's not the case, use whatever
       you have defined in place of 'flock-managed'
       
  B. Provider Account Setup:
  
    1. Add the following entries to your Static DNS (DNS Tab):
      <IP OF ALREADY RUNNING GEM REPOSITORY INSTANCE>     gems.ec2.nytimes.com
  
    2. On the Communications tab:
      a. set the Messaging Server URI to: amqps://events.ec2.nytimes.com:443/nimbul
      b. create an account publisher with the following information:
         Type: LDNS
         S3 Bucket Name: use whatever makes sense
         S3 Object Name: NimbulHosts
    
  C. Server Page
  
    1. Create a new server profile called 'AMQP Events'
      a. Set the ROLES variable to: emissary,rabbitmq-master
      b. Set the NIMBUL_PASSWORD variable to the broker password defined in your config/broker.yml
      c. Set a DNS name (e.g., events)
      d. Add the AMQP security group under the networking tab

  D. Services
  
    1. Go to https://nimbul.../service_types
       a. Add Service Type with the following information:
          Name: Events
          FQDN: events.ec2.nytimes.com
          Description: AMQP Events Service
    2. Go to https://nimbul.../service_providers
       a. Add a service provider with the following information:
          Name: "Events:<Production or Development or Whatever>" (no quotes)
          Service Type: Events
          Server: Choose the name of the events server you created (e.g., AMQP Events)
          Description: Optional
    3. Go to https://nimbul.../service_overrides
      a. Add a service override with the following information:
         Service: Events
         Provider: Events:<Production, Development or Whatever>
         Target: 'EC2 Amazon'
         Overridable: No (unless you want yes...)
  
  E. Bootstrapping AMQP Server
    1. Before starting your new AMQP Events instance, do the following:
       a. SSH into your Nimbul instance and change directory to the root of your nimbul install
          run: script/console and enter the following
               ProviderAccount.all.each dp |p|
                  unless not p.messaging_password.blank?
                    p.regenerate_messaging_password 
                    p.save(false) # don't validate this time
                  end
                end
                
    2. Now return to your cluster containing your AMQP Events server and start an instance of the AMQP Events server
    
    3. Once the instance is in Running state (it won't reach ready
       without some massaging - i.e., bootstrapping), do the following:
          a. Find the Private IP of the now running AMQP Events Instance
          b. Go to your Provider Account Page - DNS tab and add the following Static DNS Entry:
             <IP of AMQP Events Instance>  events.ec2.nytimes.com
          c. Force the LDNS to republish via the Provider Account Page - Communications Tab area
             and then jot down the URL of your hosts file that is being published
          c. SSH to your nimbul instance and perform the following
               i. edit your /etc/cloudrc and set your HOSTS_FILE_URL variable to the URL you just grabbed in c.
              ii. run the command: hostsfile_updater.sh
             iii. verify that events.ec2.nytimes.com now shows up in your /etc/hosts file
              iv. change directory to your nimbul root and run: ./restart
          d. SSH to the AMQP Events instance that is running and perform the following:
               i. type: emissary restart
              ii. Now give it about 3 seconds and then verify that the instance is now
                  showing up in "Ready" state in nimbul
             iii. If it's not, see me.
              iv. If it is, go to your provider accounts - dns page and remove the static entry for
                  events.ec2.nytimes.com. You should notice that the Service Related DNS Records
                  now shows a real IP address for the events.ec2.nytimes.com entry and not the
                  bogus 256.0.0.0 entry.
          e. Providing everything is kosher now, we need to perform one last step:
               i. SSH back into your Nimbul instance and change to the root of your nimbul install
              ii. run: script/console and enter the following
                    ProviderAccount.all.each dp |p|
                      p.send_messaging_credentials
                    end
  F. At this point, your Provider Accounts should all be configured to communicate with your
     AMQP Events instance, and you should be fully bootstrapped.
